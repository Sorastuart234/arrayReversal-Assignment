# arrayReversal-Assignment

# The following assignment asks to reverse a given list of elemnts in an array using Java and reverse and return the output while also giving the time complexity and the auxillery space for your code.

#The code itself will create a new array in the  main method and call for our new method that will reverse the given array called arrayReversal. What happens in arrayReversal is it will ask the user to input an array and create a new array based on the length of the already given array, create an index variable that will start from the last element, and loop through the newly created array and give it a value based on the last element of the given array and go down until it reaches the array length limit. Then it will return the outcome and print out the elements from the original array backwards.

# The time complexity would be O(n) given that our run time is dependent on our input size which in this case, is the array with the values we want to reverse so the time complexity would be O(n). Auxillery space however will be the same time being O(n) since again if we were to change the size of the array and either add or reduce the number of elements, the amount of space used will change n times regardless so the auxillery space for this code would be O(n).
